# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING

Read `TODO.md` in the project root. It contains the prioritized task list. Work top to bottom. Each task tells you exactly which files to modify and how to verify.

**Do not create planning documents, summaries, diagnostics, or sub-task breakdowns.** The previous agent produced 34 planning documents before making a single user-visible change. The planning is done. Write code.

Read `CLAUDE.md` for architecture context and execution rules.
