# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Purpose: capture high-impact technical decisions so future sessions can resume safely without chat history.

## Rules

- Every ADR must have:
  - Context (what problem we’re solving)
  - Options considered (2–3)
  - Decision (what we picked)
  - Consequences (tradeoffs)
  - Date
  - Related task IDs from `PLANS.md`
- ADR filenames are numbered: `0001-short-title.md`, `0002-...`
- Reference any new ADRs from `PLANS.md`.

## Template

Copy `decisions/TEMPLATE.md`.
