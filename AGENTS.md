# AGENTS.md — Planted Tank Lab Agent Guidance

This repo uses GPT 5.3 Codex as primary agent runtime.

## Skill Sources for Codex Work

When implementing or reviewing code in this repo, use these skill sources:

1) Workspace skills (global):
- `/Users/jacob/.openclaw/workspace/skills/*/SKILL.md`

2) Wednesday project skills (repo-local):
- `.wednesday/skills/wednesday-dev/SKILL.md`
- `.wednesday/skills/wednesday-design/SKILL.md`

## Usage policy

- Use `wednesday-dev` for coding standards (complexity, naming, TS/React quality).
- Use `wednesday-design` for UI/UX, component patterns, and design token consistency.
- Prefer existing approved components/patterns over custom reinvention unless explicitly justified.

## Model/Execution preference

- Preferred model: `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex`
- Preferred thinking level for deep planning/architecture: `xhigh`

## Notes

- `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, and Copilot instructions were generated by the installer for multi-agent compatibility.
- For Codex-driven workflow, this `AGENTS.md` is the primary in-repo guidance document.
