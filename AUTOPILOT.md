# AUTOPILOT - PlantedTankLab (Single Source Of Truth)

Last updated: 2026-02-11

This file is the only authoritative status board for active execution.
If chat history or older docs conflict with this file, this file wins.

## Planning System (Consolidated)

Only these four planning artifacts are active:

1. `AUTOPILOT.md` - current status, active task, next actions, resume protocol.
2. `PLAN_EXEC.md` - full executable checklist with acceptance criteria and verify steps.
3. `PROGRESS.md` - append-only session log.
4. `VERIFY.md` - launch-readiness verification playbook and gate checks.

Deprecated and archived:
- `TODO.md` (archived at `archive/planning/2026-02-11/TODO.deprecated.md`).

## Current Mission

Primary objective: complete **Top Priority #1** to production-grade quality:
- trusted ingestion + normalization + canonical data freshness pipeline.

Current phase: `ING-1` (Seed/import through ingestion pipeline).

## Current State Snapshot

Completed prerequisites:
- Fly.io web deployment is live with Cloudflare DNS pointed to Fly.
- Auth paths are functional (Google + email magic links via Resend).
- Supabase RLS hardening migration applied (`0010_enable_rls`).
- Ingestion foundation exists (jobs, runs, sources, entities, snapshots, mapping tables).

Remaining critical gap:
- seed/import data still needs to be fully ingestion-driven end-to-end with deterministic normalization and provenance guarantees.

## Active Task Queue (from `PLAN_EXEC.md`)

Execute in this order:
1. `IN-01` Manual seed ingestion source adapter + snapshot writer.
2. `IN-02` Refactor `pnpm seed` to ingestion -> normalization (no canonical bypass).
3. `IN-03` Deterministic mapping rules for products/plants/offers.
4. `IN-04` Normalization overrides + explainability metadata.
5. `IN-05` Admin mapping/override operations UI.

## Known Risks / Blockers

- Offer data completeness still depends on source coverage and parser quality.
- In-memory rate limit implementation is acceptable now but not horizontally durable.
- Sentry alerting still requires ongoing production tuning.

## Resume In <2 Minutes

1. Read `AUTOPILOT.md`.
2. Open `PLAN_EXEC.md` and find the first unchecked `[ ]` task.
3. Read last 1-3 entries in `PROGRESS.md`.
4. Run:
   - `pnpm verify:gates`
   - targeted checks for the active task (from `PLAN_EXEC.md` verify section)
5. Implement task end-to-end.
6. Update `PLAN_EXEC.md`, `AUTOPILOT.md`, and append to `PROGRESS.md`.

## No-Conflicts Rule (strict)

Do not create new planning/checkpoint files outside this system.
If a new doc is necessary, link it from this file and ensure it does not duplicate task tracking already in `PLAN_EXEC.md`.
