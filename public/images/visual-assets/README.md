# Runtime Visual Assets

Assets in this folder are served by the app at `/images/visual-assets/...`.

## Suggested flow

1. Generate and edit assets in:
   - `/Users/jacob/Projects/planted-tank-lab/visual-assets-pack-v1/`
2. Copy finalized files into this folder structure.
3. For hardscape design assets currently wired in `data/visual-assets/design-assets.json`, provide these flat files:
   - `hardscape/seiryu-boulder-large.png`
   - `hardscape/seiryu-accent-stone.png`
   - `hardscape/dragon-stone-ridge.png`
   - `hardscape/dragon-stone-accent.png`
   - `hardscape/lava-rock-cluster.png`
   - `hardscape/spider-wood-branch.png`
   - `hardscape/spider-wood-twig-set.png`
   - `hardscape/manzanita-branch.png`
   - `hardscape/mopani-root.png`
   - `hardscape/branchwood-arch.png`

You can keep additional grouped variants under their slug folders.
