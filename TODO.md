# TODO (Ready Now Queue)

This is a convenience view of the next "ready now" tasks from `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

Do not add tasks here unless they already exist in `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

## Ready Now (work top to bottom)

1. B-01 Compatibility rules required-specs contracts + missing-data UX.
2. B-02 Admin categories CRUD + reorder.
3. B-03 CSV exports (products, plants, offers).
