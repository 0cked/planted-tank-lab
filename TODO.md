# TODO (Ready Now Queue)

This is a convenience view of the next "ready now" tasks from `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

Do not add tasks here unless they already exist in `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

## Ready Now (work top to bottom)

1. C-01 Curated catalog completeness pass (core flow).
2. C-02 Plant content baseline for top 30 plants.
3. C-03 Builder completion UX + empty/offers-empty UX.
