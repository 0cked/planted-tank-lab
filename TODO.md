# TODO (Ready Now Queue)

This is a convenience view of the next "ready now" tasks from `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

Do not add tasks here unless they already exist in `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

## Ready Now (work top to bottom)

1. C-07 Builder Phase B polish (selection cards + warnings clarity + mobile pass).
2. C-08 Phase C browsing polish (products + plants feel like a hobby catalog).
3. D-01 Consent-respecting analytics/events (minimal).
