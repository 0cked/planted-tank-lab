# TODO (Ready Now Queue)

This is a convenience view of the next "ready now" tasks from `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

Do not add tasks here unless they already exist in `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

## Ready Now (work top to bottom)

1. C-05 Shared build snapshot page: nav state + CTA clarity.
2. C-06 Content + imagery baseline (products + plants + hardscape).
3. D-01 Consent-respecting analytics/events (minimal).
