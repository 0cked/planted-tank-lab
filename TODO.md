# TODO (Ready Now Queue)

This is a convenience view of the next "ready now" tasks from `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

Do not add tasks here unless they already exist in `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

## Ready Now (work top to bottom)

1. E-04 Seed/import flows through ingestion → normalization (no bypass).
2. E-05 Canonical mapping + duplicate resolution foundations.
3. E-06 Cache boundaries for read-heavy views.
