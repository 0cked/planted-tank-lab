# TODO (Ready Now Queue)

This is a convenience view of the next "ready now" tasks from `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

Do not add tasks here unless they already exist in `PLAN_EXEC.md`.

## Ready Now (work top to bottom)

1. F-04 Deploy to Fly (web + worker + scheduler) and verify health.
2. F-05 Cut DNS over from Vercel → Fly and verify auth callbacks.
3. E-04 Seed/import flows through ingestion → normalization (no bypass).
